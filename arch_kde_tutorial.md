# Complete Arch Linux Tutorial (KDE Plasma + Wayland w/ Automounting Partitions)

This is a Arch installation guide for noobs **WITHOUT LUKS encryption and SecureBoot** who just want a working system to game on that's straight forward with a DE that is most like Windows
and usually the one most people want to use because of that, at least for their first DE. I've used every DE and WM that is both trendy and some obscure,
I started with KDE Plasma and Arch Linux. I always come back to both eventually. It's fun to try out new things, but KDE Plasma is OP at the moment I am writing 
this. It's fully featured, they finally have a good process in eliminating bugs which plagued the DE before, and it's very easy to customize. Most DEs and WMs have
some caveat, KDE Plasma does not. That is why I use it.


## NOTE (ACTUALLY READ THIS): 

So, I like to use something called `systemd-gpt-auto-generator`. I acknowledge that this is a super opinionated decision for a noob tutorial, and I debated whether or not to use it in this tutorial, but I feel it's so cromulent and underrated that I decided to make a big decision to teach you how to use it as well. If you follow this guide correctly and use it you'll see why it's very convenient.
It is not usually done on Linux and it is kind of new(?), at least relative to `fstab`, however it is a modern way of mounting partitions that are also used by other operating systems you may already be familiar with. 

---

# INTRODUCTION - How GPT Auto-Mounting Works

Modern systemd uses `systemd-gpt-auto-generator` to automatically discover and mount partitions based on specific 128-bit **UUIDs,** eliminating the need for manual `/etc/fstab` entries. This system is useful for centralizing file system configuration in the partition table and making configuration in `/etc/fstab` or on the kernel command line unnecessary. This is similar to the OS you probably switched away from and are more familiar with; Windows. - Windows identifies volumes by what they call "GUIDs" (Volume{GUID} paths). Now for your sake all you need to know is that a GUID is functionally the same thing as the specific 128-bit UUIDs that we will use on Linux, but instead of mounting to `boot` or `root` they mount their "GUIDs" to set drives defined by a letter, so `C:` drives and `D:` drives. That is why some letters are reserved for largely depreciated functions, as mounting on Windows is identified by a set identifier just like your system's UUIDs will do.

Your drive partitions like `boot` and `root` will not be mounted by `fstab`, instead they will automount entirely by using UUIDs by using `systemd-gpt-auto-generator`. This is preferable in my opinion to `fstab` which feels like a hack and places too much control of system reliance upon a single text based config. This is anecdotal, but I have heard of what happens when some package or update randomly decides to destroy your `fstab` and it is **NOT** fun to troubleshoot if it happens. It's often difficult to know what is going wrong and many hours will be wasted until you realize your fstab for whatever reason is empty or has some typos.

Now this is still unconventional which is part of the fun of using this as it justifies the manual install, but since it is unique it's worth familiarizing yourself with how this works before following my guide. I will add a small tutorial on how you would go about adding a new SSD later on with this, it's a *tiny* bit different but still very easy to do. -- **PLEASE NOTE:** that there are extra steps to subvolumes if you choose to use this with **BTRFS,** since subvolumes like snapshots usually require `fstab`. I might write a small tutorial on what you need to do with BTRFS for this type of system if I ever decide to use that filesystem, but essentially instead of `fstab` you just use systemd service for each instead which is also what you will do for new drives. 

## The UUIDs

When you use the partition type codes in this guide:
- `EF00` (EFI System Partition)
- `8304` (Linux x86-64 root)  

systemd automatically creates mount units based on these partition type UUIDs. Each hex code corresponds to a specific 128-bit UUID that tells the system exactly what that partition is for. The system recognizes these GUIDs and then mounts accordingly, just like a modern system should. This approach is similar to how partitioning works on other systems.
For extra storage you can use the generic Linux filesystem code:
- `8300`

systemd won't auto-mount these, giving you control over when and where they mount which again to me is ideal, if need be you can mount them on boot with a systemd service. This allows you to avoid `fstab` issues forever. No more random issues where it's suddenly overwritten for some reason or anything else, mounting is seperate and automated.

---

# - CONS: -

Same Disk Only: Auto-mounting only works for partitions on the same physical disk as your root partition.

Boot Loader Dependency: The boot loader must set the `LoaderDevicePartUUID` EFI variable for root partition detection to work. systemd-boot (used in this guide) supports this. Check if the bootloader you wish to use does.
For GRUB to set the `LoaderDevicePartUUID` UEFI variable load the bli module in grub.cfg:
```ini
if [ "$grub_platform" = "efi" ]; then
  insmod bli
fi
```

First Partition Rule: systemd mounts the first partition of each type it finds. If you have multiple 8302 partitions on the same disk, **then only the first one gets auto-mounted.**

No Multi-Disk Support: This won't work on systems where the root filesystem is distributed across multiple disks (like BTRFS RAID).

# - PROS: -

Portability: Your disk image can boot on different hardware without `fstab` changes

Self-Describing: The partition table contains all mounting information

Container-Friendly: Tools like systemd-nspawn can automatically set up filesystems from GPT images

Reduced Maintenance: No broken boots from typos in `/etc/fstab` or random updates doing weird stuff messing with it.

## What I will mainly be using/setting:

- systemd-automount for GPT partitions 
- KDE Plasma on Wayland
- NVME SSD
- `linux-zen` default kernel which is a kernel optimized for desktop use.
- `linux-lts` for a fallback and debug kernel
- zsh default shell
- systemd-boot with UKIs
- zswap with a 16 GiB swap file
- EXT4 for `/`
- AMD CPU + NVIDIA GPU w/ `nvidia-open-dkms` 
**NOTE:** This tutorial assumes you have a Turing (NV160/TUXXX) and newer	card for current driver. Check your card first.

I included some stuff for AMDGPUs too, but my system is NVIDIA so I may have missed some things.

NVIDIA modeset is set by default, and according to the wiki setting fbdev manually is now unnecessary so I will not set those. PLEASE check the wiki before install for anything. **POST-INSTALL GUIDE IS SUPER OPINIONATED, FOLLOW BY OWN VOLITION.**

*Protip:* This tutorial uses Norwegian keymaps and locale/timezone settings. Simply replace those with your own (e.g. keymap, `LANG`, `TZ`).
If you use an English lang keyboard you can ignore all of it, but it's worth knowing if you are new and use a different keyboard like say `de-latin1` for German keyboards.

**NOTE:** **This tutorial assumes you have a NVME SSD,** which are named `/dev/nvme0n1`. If you don't have that, it's something else. If you don't know, check with `lsblk -l` to see your scheme. It could be `sda` or something else. If it is something else replace all instances of `nvme0n1` and remove the `p` from  `${d}p1` in the formatting.

*Sidenote:* Unless you like the name, replace my hostname (basically the name of your rig) of `BigBlue` with yours, same as my user name `lars` if your name ain't Lars. Though if it is, cool. Hi! I thought about doing placeholders but I feel those are more distracting usually, I prefer to see how something would actually work in a guide, maybe you do as well?


## Prerequisites

- A bootable Arch Linux USB (written with `dd` or similar)
- Internet connection
- UEFI system


---


### TUTORIAL PROPER

**GPT Auto-Mount + KDE Plasma (Wayland) + NVIDIA**

> **Prerequisites:** This guide assumes you have an AMD processor with NVIDIA graphics. For Intel CPUs, replace `amd-ucode` with `intel-ucode` throughout the installation.
For AMDGPU or Intel GPU you should look either up at the Arch Wiki and replace the corresponding packages with those. I'd rather not clutter up the guide with a bunch of different setups, especially if I've never used those. It just confuses new users, like placeholders.



## Step 0: Boot from ISO

Set up your keyboard layou if you're not on an US keyboard, and verify UEFI boot:

```bash
# Set your keyboard layout, you can skip this is u use a normal keyboard (US)
# each line in these code blocks is a separate line in the terminal FYI

# # List all keymaps (scrollable):
localectl list-keymaps | less

# or filter by country code by writing:
localectl list-keymaps | grep -i -E 'no'                   # Norway example
                                                           # "no" is our ISO-639 code. Find yours by googling first
                                                           # Then replace 'no' with your country code                 

# For Norway it's "no-latin1". On Arch it's usually "*-latin1" and not just the country code.
# Test out your keyboard after this, if it is wrong try another on the list.
#
# To write "-" on US keyboard which you will need to do to be able to write this command,
# it's usually the first key left of backspace. For Norwegian/Nordic keyboard that's: \.
loadkeys no-latin1

# the default font for an arch install is tiny and it only gets worse as you get older
# here is how you get it to something readable
setfont ter-118n

# if that is not big enough try this:
setfont ter-132n    

# and if even that is not big enough:
setfont -d ter-132n  

# Verify UEFI firmware, write it all out including && and echo.
# It's just going to be a bunch of random variables that's confusing, however...
#
# If it says the quote at the end there then you are good.
ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars && echo "UEFI firmware detected"

# Sync system clock
timedatectl set-ntp true

# --- Web Test (wired & Wi-Fi) ---

# See your links & their state (names like enpXsY for Ethernet, wlan0 for Wi-Fi)
ip link           # interface listing
networkctl list   # networkd's view; "configured" with DHCP is what you want

---

Ethernet:

# If you're on Ethernet, DHCP should be automatic on the ISO.
# You can confirm an IPv4/IPv6 address like:
networkctl status | sed -n '1,80p'   # look for "Address:" and "Gateway:"

---

Wi-Fi:

# If you're on Wi-Fi, (1) make sure nothing is soft-blocked, (2) connect with iwctl.
rfkill list
rfkill unblock all         # if you see "Soft blocked: yes" for wlan      (safe to run always)

# Discover your wireless device name (often "wlan0" on ISO)
iwctl device list          

# Scan & connect (replace SSID if your AP name has spaces keep the quotes)
iwctl station "YOUR-DEV" scan
iwctl station "YOUR-DEV" get-networks
iwctl station "YOUR-DEV" connect "YOUR-SSID"   # iwctl will prompt for passphrase

---

# DNS & IP sanity checks (these distinguish raw IP reachability vs DNS resolution)
ping -c 3 1.1.1.1            # raw IP reachability (no DNS involved)
resolvectl query archlinux.org
ping -c 3 archlinux.org

# HTTPS test (TLS & HTTP working)
curl -I https://archlinux.org  # expect "HTTP/2 200" (or 301/302)

# Time sync sanity (NTP via systemd-timesyncd)
timedatectl status | sed -n '1,12p'  # look for "System clock synchronized: yes"
```

## Step 1: Partition the NVMe drive with systemd-repart

```bash
lsblk -l

# Set the device you want to operate on
d=/dev/nvme0n1   # change if lsblk shows a different path

# Define the desired partitions for systemd-repart using nano
mkdir -p /tmp/repart.d
```

```bash
# Create 10-esp.conf
nano /tmp/repart.d/10-esp.conf

# 10-esp.conf
[Partition]
Type=esp
Label=EFI
Format=vfat
SizeMinBytes=1G
SizeMaxBytes=1G
```

```bash
# Create 20-root.conf
nano /tmp/repart.d/20-root.conf

# 20-root.conf
[Partition]
Type=root
Label=root
Format=ext4
```

```bash
# Preview the plan 
systemd-repart --definitions=/tmp/repart.d --empty=force "$d"

# Apply the changes for real. Pick ONE of these options.
#
# OPTION A) Normally without fast_commit:
#
systemd-repart --definitions=/tmp/repart.d --dry-run=no --empty=force "$d"

---

# OPTION B) If you want `fast_commit` enabled you run this command.
#
# ext4 has a faster journaling system called fast_commit
# According to the Arch wiki it supposedly improves performance:
#
SYSTEMD_REPART_MKFS_OPTIONS_EXT4='-O fast_commit' \
  systemd-repart --definitions=/tmp/repart.d --dry-run=no --empty=force "$d"

---

# Optional: verify results
lsblk -f "$d"

# Optional: verify fast_commit results
# You should see fast_commit listed under features:
tune2fs -l /dev/disk/by-label/root | grep features

# optional, stronger check:
dumpe2fs -h /dev/disk/by-label/root | grep -i 'Fast commit length'
```

## Step 2: Mount filesystems (labels match your original layout)

```bash
# Mount root first
mount /dev/disk/by-label/root /mnt

# Create and mount EFI directory
mkdir -p /mnt/efi
mount /dev/disk/by-label/EFI /mnt/efi
```

## Step 3: Base System Install

First update mirrorlist for optimal download speeds, obv replace Norway and Germany.
A good rule of thumb here is doing your country + closest neighbours and then a few larger neighbours after that.
So for me it's Norway,Sweden,Denmark then Germany,Netherlands:

```bash
# Update mirrorlist before install so you install with fastest mirrors
#
# PROTIP: "\" is a pipe, it basically is a fancy way to add a space to a bash command.
# So essentially just write each line until there isnt a "\" and it will run it all as one command.
# This is good for keeping large commands digestible during install.
#
reflector \ # this is a line, press enter                                      
      --country 'Norway,Sweden,Denmark,Germany,Netherlands' \  # and it goes to the 2nd line, do same as first
      --age 12 \ # same here & etc under  
      --protocol https \ 
      --sort rate \
      --latest 10 \
      --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist  # then when pressing enter here w/o "\" it will run all the lines

# When you understand all of this you can use a faster version of this
# that I like to use:
reflector -c NO,SE,DK,DE,NL -a 12 -p https \
-l 10 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

and then **Install the base of Arch Linux!** :

```bash
# For AMD CPUs:
pacstrap /mnt base linux-zen linux-lts linux-firmware amd-ucode nano sudo zsh

# For Intel CPUs:
pacstrap /mnt base linux-zen linux-lts linux-firmware intel-ucode nano sudo zsh
```

## Step 4: System Configuration

### 4.1 Enter the New System

```bash
# However before you can say you've installed arch you need to configure the system
# This is how you chroot into your newly installed system:
#
arch-chroot /mnt
```

### 4.2 Set Timezone

```bash
# Set timezone to your own continent and city
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Oslo /etc/localtime

# Set hardware clock
hwclock --systohc
```

### 4.3 Configure Locale

```bash
# Now we are going to configure our system language.
# I am going to have my system be in English,
# but my time and date will be set as it is in Norway.
# So an English system with a DD/MM/YYYY and 00:00 "military clock".
#
nano /etc/locale.gen

# Go down the list and uncomment both:
Uncomment: en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 # English
Uncomment: nb_NO.UTF-8 UTF-8 # Bokmål Norwegian (replace with your own or leave out)

# Then generate locales
locale-gen

# Set system locale
nano /etc/locale.conf

# add
LANG=en_US.UTF-8    # LANG for system language
LC_TIME=nb_NO.UTF-8 # LC_TIME for date & time to my specific LANG default


# Set console keymap & font
nano /etc/vconsole.conf

# add
KEYMAP=no-latin1 # Skip this if US keyboard
FONT=ter-118n  # But add this.
               # This is a console font which makes it larger,
               # and more easily readable on boot

```

### 4.4 Set Hostname and Hosts

```bash
# Set hostname, echo lets you do it quickly w/o using nano
# good for one line stuff
#
echo "BigBlue" > /etc/hostname

# Configure hosts file
nano /etc/hosts

## add to /etc/hosts:
127.0.0.1 localhost BigBlue
::1       localhost
```

### 4.5 Create User Account

```bash
# Set root password
passwd

# Create user with necessary groups
useradd -m -G wheel lars
passwd lars

# Set zsh as default shell for user and root
chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh lars
chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh

# Enable sudo for wheel group
EDITOR=nano visudo
# Uncomment: %wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

## 4.5.5 Package Choice

### Info:
I have taken the liberty to make some decisions for a few packages you will install, some of them are technically "optional" but
all of them are in my opinion essential to the well functioning of a KDE Plasma desktop except for kitty and pkgstats. 

Here's why I included those:


### pkgstats 
pkstats is a super harmless way to help out the Arch developers that work hard and mostly for free to make our wonderful distro.
It basically just advertises a list of your core and extra packages that you use to them  so they can know what packages to 
prioritize in testing and for other things. If you are extremely paranoid then you can leave it out.

### kitty 
kitty is a terminal that I think is the best sort of default terminal on Linux. It's easy to use, GPU accelerated, fast enough and hassle free.
It allows you to zoom in by pressing `CTRL + SHIFT and +` and zoom out by `CTRL + SHIFT and -` It doesn't look terrible like some terminals do.
konsole is included as a backup. If you want to use another terminal as your main, replace it.

---

## **NOT INCLUDED IN THE STEP BUT YOU MAY WANT TO INCLUDE:**

### wireless-regdb
If you use wireless then an **essential package** is also `wireless-regdb`. It installs regulatory.db, a machine-readable table of Wi-Fi rules per country  that allows you to connect properly. If regulatory.db is missing or cannot be read, Linux falls back to the “world” regdomain 00. That profile is **intentionally conservative,** which means fewer channels and more restrictions. For example, world 00 marks many 5 GHz channels as passive-scan only and limits parts of 2.4 GHz (12–13 passive, 14 effectively off).

### audiocd-kio
This adds the audiocd:/ KIO worker so Dolphin and other KDE apps can read and rip audio CDs. Not needed on non-KDE Plasma systems, but KDE has their own thing with this for some reason. If you are on a laptop with a CD player then you are going to want this.

### libdvdread, libdvdnav, and libdvdcss
This is the same as above but for DVD playback. This is needed on any DE.

### libbluray and libaacs
Same for Blu-Rays. After you have installed the system and configured an AUR helper you may also wish to install **libbdplus** from the AUR if you want for BD+ playback. From there you will have to set it up with KEYS which is shown on the Arch Wiki about Blu-Ray.

### bluez and bluez-utils
For Bluetooth support if you use Bluetooth. You will also need to enable `bluetooth.service` then at the end of the tutorial.

### cups & cups-pdf (Optional: bluez-cups for Bluetooth printers)
If you need printer support. You will also need to enable `cups.service` at the end of the tutorial.

# 4.6 Install the System

```bash
# Update package database
pacman -Syu
```

**EITHER**

NVIDIA: 
```bash
# pipe commands, like before type out each pipe line, press enter on each until base-devel
# then when u press enter it installs it all
pacman -S --needed \
  networkmanager reflector pkgstats \
  pipewire pipewire-alsa pipewire-pulse pipewire-jack wireplumber \

```

or Intel GPUs (I think):
```bash
pacman -S --needed \
  networkmanager reflector pkgstats \
  pipewire pipewire-alsa pipewire-pulse pipewire-jack wireplumber \
  plasma-meta dolphin dolphin-plugins konsole kitty kio-admin \

  ttf-dejavu ttf-liberation ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols \
  hunspell hunspell-en_us quota-tools usbutils \
  pacman-contrib git wget \
  base-devel
```



### 4.6 Configure Initramfs

```bash
# Edit mkinitcpio configuration
nano /etc/mkinitcpio.conf

---

# Example for MODULES if you use nvidia:
MODULES=(nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm)

---

# Example for MODULES if you use amdgpu
# Officially supported kernels enable AMDGPU support for cards of the Southern Islands (GCN 1, released in 2012)
# and Sea Islands (GCN 2, released in 2013).
#
# The amdgpu kernel driver needs to be loaded before the radeon one.
# You can check which kernel driver is loaded by running lspci -k.
#
MODULES=(amdgpu)

# or if you have radeon as well
# do this so amdgpu loads first:
MODULES=(amdgpu radeon)

---

# Example for HOOKS
HOOKS=(base systemd autodetect microcode modconf keyboard sd-vconsole block filesystems fsck)

# Key changes:
# - MUST use 'systemd' instead of 'udev' 
# - Use 'sd-vconsole' instead of 'keymap' and 'consolefont'
# - Remove 'kms' from HOOKS=() also if you use nvidia, AMDGPU can ignore this however
# - Ensure microcode is in HOOKS=()
#
# NOTE: IF you do not remove udev and if you do not replace it with systemd,
# THEN YOUR SYSTEM WILL NOT BOOT.
# This is the only pitfall with systemd-gpt-auto-generator,
#
# It's worth doublechecking.
# Check this again if your system isn't booting post-install.

```

### 4.8 Install UKIs and Configure Bootloader

```bash
# Install systemd-boot
#
# NOTE: Remember to include `--variables=yes` flag. - Here's why:
# Starting with systemd version 257, bootctl began detecting
# environments like arch-chroot as containers...
#
# This is an intended change and without it, it silently skips
# the step of writing EFI variables to NVRAM...
#
# For non-nerds: This prevents issues where the boot entry
# might not appear in the firmware's boot menu...
#
bootctl install --esp-path=/efi --variables=yes

# Minimal cmdline with kernel option(s)
nano /etc/kernel/cmdline

# These are the only kernel flags needed for this setup
# With GPT Autoloader you do not need to specify UUIDs here
#
# rootflags add options to the root filesystem, like noatime
# noatime is a typical optimization for EXT4 systems.
# nowatchdog is also optimization. Both of them are unneeded for single use desktops.
# they are on for "over-security"/kernel default reasons only.
# many distros ship with nowatchdog and noatime, EOS for example.
#
# if you really are worried about if you need them (you probably dont) then you can
# research them independently
#
# loglevel=3 just increases verbosity in logging.
#
# zswap.compressor=lz4 switches compressor to lz4 from zstd, lz4 is considered faster
#
# If you are using AMDGPU and Radeon and it insists on using Radeon instead,
# You can add either of these depending on your card here to force the loading of AMDGPU:
#
# Southern Islands (SI): radeon.si_support=0 amdgpu.si_support=1
# Sea Islands (CIK): radeon.cik_support=0 amdgpu.cik_support=1
#
## /etc/kernel/cmdline
rw rootflags=noatime nowatchdog loglevel=3 zswap.compressor=lz4
```

#### Make the ESP directory
```bash
# Make ESP directory
mkdir -p /efi/EFI/Linux
```

#### Edit the mkinitcpio presets so they write UKIs to the ESP

```bash
nano /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux-zen.preset

# Content:
ALL_kver="/boot/vmlinuz-linux-zen"
PRESETS=('default')

default_uki="/efi/EFI/Linux/arch-linux-zen.efi"
```

#### Repeat for LTS:

```bash
nano /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux-lts.preset

# Content:
ALL_kver="/boot/vmlinuz-linux-lts"
PRESETS=('default')

default_uki="/efi/EFI/Linux/arch-linux-lts.efi"

```

#### Build the UKIs / This writes both kernel *.efi's into ESP/EFI/Linux/:

```bash
mkinitcpio -P
```

#### Configure bootloader

```bash
# write the loader
nano /efi/loader/loader.conf

## add to loader
timeout 10
console-mode auto
editor no
```

### 4.9 Create swap file & Configure Zswap

```bash
# Create a 16 GiB swap file and initialize it in one step.
#   --size 16G   -> allocate a 16 GiB file
#   --file       -> create the file with correct mode and real blocks
#   -U clear     -> clear any existing UUID in the header
mkswap -U clear --size 16G --file /swapfile
```

edit:
```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/swapfile.swap
```
and add:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Swap file

[Swap]
What=/swapfile
Priority=100

[Install]
WantedBy=swap.target
```
then:
```bash
systemctl enable swapfile.swap
```

Optimizations for swap use:

```bash
# These are optimizations taken from the wiki.
# Generally considered to be optimal.
nano /etc/sysctl.d/99-zswap.conf

# add
vm.swappiness = 100
vm.page-cluster = 0
vm.watermark_boost_factor = 0
vm.watermark_scale_factor = 125

# update the sysctl
sysctl --system
```

#### Force GTK to use Portals
```bash
# This is important for file pickers etc
# Sometimes programs insist on using the wrong one
# instead of Dolphin (Your File Manager)
#
mkdir -p /etc/environment.d
nano /etc/environment.d/99-portal.conf 
```
```ini
# 99-portal.conf 
GTK_USE_PORTAL=1
GDK_DEBUG=portals
```

### 4.10 Enable Essential Services

```bash
# Enable network, display manager, and timesyncd
# Include cups.service if you are using printer
# Include bluetooth.service for Bluetooth if you installed bluez and bluez-utils
systemctl enable NetworkManager sddm systemd-timesyncd systemd-boot-update.service \
fstrim.timer reflector.timer pkgstats.timer
```

## Step 5: Complete Installation

```bash
# Exit chroot environment
exit

# Unmount all partitions
umount -R /mnt

# Reboot into new system
shutdown now

# Remove ArchISO USB from computer then boot back into it

# If you see a very generic type of screen, dont worry. That happens to me on every install.
#
# To fix, log in to the system and launch "System Settings" from the Start Menu (Application launcher)
# 
# Navigate to Colors & Themes -> Login Screen (SDDM) -> then select "Breeze" and hit Apply
# It will then have applied it and on next reboot and others after it will persist
# 
# This is also the way to fix if the taskbar (panel) appears on the wrong monitor, simply go to Global Theme
# Press Breeze or Breeze-Dark, select BOTH checkboxes and hit apply. Wait and then it will correctly apply
# This will also persist on reboots as well. Two odd bugs I've ran into but not something that persists afterwards.

# 2) OPTIONAL: How to fix those annoying 'missing firmware' warnings in mkinitcpio

* Whenever you write `mkinitcpio -P` you might notice it keeps warning you about firmware that you are supposedly missing.
* This only seems to happen on fallback which we disabled here but if you didn't you will see them.
* If this bothers you, check out my tutorial, `mkinitcpio-fix.md` to fix this.
